# Real-ESRGAN Fine-Tuning for Super-Resolution on CIFAR-100

## Project Overview
This project leverages the Real-ESRGAN architecture to perform super-resolution on the CIFAR-100 dataset, transforming low-resolution (32x32) images into high-resolution (128x128) images. Real-ESRGAN is fine-tuned with advanced loss functions, data augmentation, and optimized training techniques to improve perceptual quality and sharpness of the generated images.

Super-resolution has practical applications in fields like image restoration, media enhancement, and artifact recovery. This project is part of a broader initiative focused on artifact restoration.

## Key Features
- **Model Architecture**: Fine-tuning of Real-ESRGAN with enhanced perceptual and adversarial loss functions.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: 
  - Normalization of CIFAR-100 images to [-1, 1].
  - Creation of low-resolution counterparts using bicubic interpolation.
  - Upscaling high-resolution images to 128x128 for a 4x resolution factor.
- **Data Augmentation**:
  - Horizontal/vertical flips, rotations, and random noise addition to improve generalization.
- **Loss Functions**:
  - L1 Loss for pixel-level similarity.
  - Perceptual Loss using VGG-19 features for improved texture and detail reconstruction.
  - GAN Loss for sharper and more realistic outputs.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Mixed-precision training with PyTorchâ€™s AMP.
  - Gradient clipping and a cosine annealing scheduler for better convergence.
  - Trained on NVIDIA A100 GPU.

## Results
The model achieved the following average metrics:
- **PSNR**: XX.X dB
- **SSIM**: 0.XXXX
- Performance was visualized on test samples, showing clear improvements but also highlighting challenges with fine texture recovery.

## Future Work
This project serves as a stepping stone for a larger artifact restoration project. Future enhancements will involve:
- Further fine-tuning for improved texture and detail preservation.
- Incorporating domain-specific datasets for artifact-specific super-resolution.
- Exploring lightweight models for deployment on edge devices.
