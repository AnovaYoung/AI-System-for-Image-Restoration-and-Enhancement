Plan for Combining Data Sources
Datasets to Combine
ImageNet

Why Use It: A vast dataset with high-quality images suitable for generating degraded versions for tasks like denoising and super-resolution.
Usage: Use a subset for variety (e.g., nature, urban, and object categories).
COCO (Common Objects in Context)

Why Use It: Includes real-world images with annotations that can aid in segmenting damaged areas for inpainting tasks.
Usage: Focus on diverse, complex scenes (e.g., crowd scenes for noise and missing sections).
Custom Augmented Dataset

Why Use It: To introduce specific degradations (e.g., noise, low resolution, grayscale) to make the data more tailored to restoration tasks.
Usage: Generate degraded versions using augmentation pipelines on both ImageNet and COCO data.
Specialized Colorization Dataset (Optional)

Example: Unsplash/DIV2K Grayscale Subsets
Why Use It: Focuses on grayscale images for tasks like colorization.
Usage: Mix in grayscale samples for additional variety.
Steps to Combine Data Sources
Data Selection:

Sample subsets from ImageNet and COCO.
Prioritize high-resolution images for consistent results.
Augmentation Pipeline:

Denoising: Add Gaussian noise and random artifacts to clean images.
Super-Resolution: Downsample high-resolution images to create low-res versions.
Colorization: Convert selected images to grayscale.
Inpainting: Mask random portions of images to simulate missing sections.
Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicate images.
Standardize image sizes (e.g., 256x256 pixels) for compatibility with generative models.
Normalize pixel values to a range of 0â€“1 for consistency across models.
Database Structure:

Create labeled directories or a metadata file (e.g., a CSV) to track:
Original Image
Task-Specific Degradation (e.g., noise level, mask location, resolution scaling factor)
Validation/Test Set Assignments
Merge and Split:

Combine datasets into train, validation, and test splits.
Balance the number of samples across categories and degradation types.
Tools for Efficient Merging
Python Libraries: Use libraries like pandas for metadata tracking and Albumentations for augmentations.
Storage and Access: Use Google Drive, AWS S3, or Hugging Face Datasets for efficient storage and access during model training.
Expected Output
A robust and diverse dataset with:
Clean images and their degraded counterparts.
Sufficient examples for each enhancement task.
Well-balanced train-validation-test splits to ensure reliable performance evaluation.
